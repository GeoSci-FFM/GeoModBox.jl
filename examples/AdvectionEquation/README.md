# Advection Equation (2D)

This directory provides examples for solving the two-dimensional advection equation. The included examples demonstrate the application of numerical schemes under different conditions:

- [2D Advection with a Constant Velocity Field](2D_Advection.jl)
- [Resolution Test for 2D Advection](2D_Advection_ResolutionTest.jl)

For detailed explanations of the numerical methods and the implementation of each example, please refer to the [GeoModBox.jl documentation](https://geosci-ffm.github.io/GeoModBox.jl/).
