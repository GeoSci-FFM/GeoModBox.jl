    "We consider equation (2) in a 2D rectangular domain with width $L = 4000$ m and depth $H = 2000$ m. Within the domain, a body with high heat production is embedded, defined by the corner coordinates (x, z) in km: (1900, 900), (2100, 900), (2100, 1100), and (1900, 1100). The volumetric heat production $\\rho H$ is 0.3 W/m<sup>3</sup> inside the body and 0 outside. The thermal conductivity is $k = 6.5$ W/(m·K). A Dirichlet boundary condition $T = 0$ °C is imposed along all boundaries.\n",

    "This configuration roughly represents the situation of high-level radioactive waste disposal in a salt dome. Radioactive containers with a diameter of 1 m are stored in boreholes about 250 m deep at a depth of ~1 km. The average spacing of such boreholes is about 50 m over a width of 250 m and a length of 1–2 km. With a heat production rate of slightly less than 1 kW per 1 m high container, the average volumetric heat production in the storage area corresponds approximately to the value used above.\n",

    "$q_{i,j} = -k \\frac{\\partial{T}}{\\partial{x_{i,j}}}$ is defined at the midpoints of the grid lines and the temperature at the centers of the grid cells. (Strictly speaking, the thermal conductivity is then also defined on the grid lines; however, since it is constant, we do not need to consider this here. For variable thermal parameters, the discretization would need to be modified.)  \n",

    "\n",
    "For each grid point (i.e., for each equation), a so-called numerical *stencil* specifies the positions of the grid points relevant to that equation. The coefficients for these points are nonzero, while all others are zero. The stencil nomenclature often follows that of a compass, with points at South, West, Center, East, and North. For each equation, the global index ($ii$) of the stencil points is given by their relative position to the central stencil point:  \n",
