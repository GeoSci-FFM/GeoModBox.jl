# GeoModBox.jl
The **Geod**ynamic **Mod**elling Tool**Box** is a julia package mainly used for teaching purposes. The package provides different finite difference, staggered, discretization schemes to numerically solve the governing equations for a two-dimensional geodynamic problem. The governing equations are the conservation equations of 

1) [**energy**](./docs/src/man/DiffMain.md), 
2) [**momentum**](./docs/src/man/MomentumMain.md), 
3)  [**mass** and **compositon**](./docs/src/man/AdvectMain.md). 

The ```GeoModBox.jl``` includes a series of [exercises](/exercises/) and [examples](/examples/) of different geodynamically well defined problems. The exercises are given as Jupyter notebooks for the students to complete. The solutions of the exercises are available upon request. The goal of the course is to teach the students the advantages and disadvantages of certain finite difference scheme, to combine different solution techniques and to finally build a two-dimensional, thermal convection model. The theoretical background and detailed explenations of the examples and functions are mainly given in the [documentation](https://geosci-ffm.github.io/GeoModBox.jl/).

<!-- ## Structure

The ```GeoModBox.jl``` is a two-dimensional, staggered, finite difference code to solve the governing equations for certain geodynamical problems (so far, only for linear viscous problems). One can use the solvers for the *temperature*, *momentum*, and *mass* equations seperately or couple them using a so-called *operator splitting* method. 

In any case, first, one needs to setup the specific model parameters, that is the geometry (xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax), the grid (e.g., nc, nv, $\Delta$), and the physical constants (e.g., $\rho$, $\eta$).

Second, one needs to allocate the array of each needed variable. Third, one needs to define the boundary conditions and the initial time stepping. Before the time loop, one also needs to initialize the tracers and the parameters for the system of equations. Some initial conditions (temperature, density, velocity) can be setup, either via the marker funktion ```IniTracer2D()``` or the functions located in 2Dini.jl.

Within the time loop, one first solves the *momentum* equation, followed by the reevaluation of the time step. Second, one solves the *advection* part of the *temperature equation*, followed by its *diffusion* part. All figures can either be stored for certain time steps or as *gif* animations of the entire problem. 

For more details on how to use the different functions, please see the [examples](./examples/), [exercises](./exercises/), and [documentation](https://geosci-ffm.github.io/GeoModBox.jl/).

**Figure 3. Rigid-Body-Rotation.** Time-dependent solution of a rotating circular temperature anomaly using the **upwind (first)**, **semi-lagrangian (second)**, and **tracer (third)** method. Within a circular area of our model domain the velocity is set to the velocity of a rigid rotation and outside euqal to zero. The temperature is scaled by the maximum temperature of the anomaly. Empty cells are not refilled with markers.

**Figure 4. Isoviscous Falling Block.** Time-dependent solution of an isoviscous falling block example. The problem is solved with a solver for variable viscosities. The tracers advect the phase ID, which is used to interpolate the density and viscosity on the centroids and vertices, respectively.
