# GeoModBox.jl

The **Geod**ynamic **Mod**elling Tool**Box** is a julia package mainly used for teaching purposes. The package provides different finite difference, staggered, discretization schemes to numerically solve the governing equations for a two-dimensional geodynamic problem. The governing equations are the conservation equations of 
1) [**energy**](./man/DiffMain.md), 
2) [**momentum**](./man/MomentumMain.md), 
3)  [**mass** and **compositon**](./man/AdvectMain.md). 

The ```GeoModBox.jl``` includes a series of [exercises](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/exercises/) and [examples](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/examples/) of different geodynamically well defined problems. The exercises are given as Jupyter notebooks for the students to complete. The theoretical background is mainly given here in the documentation.

## Staggered Finite Difference 

------------------

## [Energy Conservation Equation](./man/DiffMain.md)

In geodynamics, the energy is described by the temperature and needs to be conserved within a closed system. Here, we solve the *temperature conservation equation*, or *temperature equation*, using an operator splitting method, that is, we first solve the *advective* part of the *temperature equation*, followed by the *diffusive* part. 

------------------

### [Heat Diffusion Equation](./examples/DiffusionEquation/1D/README.md)

The ```GeoModBox.jl``` provides different finite difference (**FD**) schemes (e.g., [forward](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/src/HeatEquation/ForwardEuler.jl) and [backward](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/src/HeatEquation/BackwardEuler.jl) Euler, [Crank-Nicholson approach](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/src/HeatEquation/CNA.jl), [ADI](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/src/HeatEquation/ADI.jl)) to solve the *diffusive part* of the time-dependent or steady-state *temperature equation* including radioactive heating, in [1-D](./man/DiffOneD.md) and [2-D](./man/DiffTwoD.md). The solvers are located in [src/HeatEquation](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/src/HeatEquation/). So far, only *Dirichlet* and *Neumann* thermal boundary conditions are available. Currently, most of the functions assume constant thermal parameters (except for the 1-D solvers). 

The examples of solving the *heat diffusion equation* include, amongst others: 
- the determination of an [oceanic](./man/examples/OceanicGeotherm_1D.jl) and [continental](./man/examples/ContinentalGeotherm_1D.md) 1-D geotherm profile, 
- [a comparison of the different **FD**-schemes applied on a 1-D gaussian temperature anomaly](./man/examples/Heat_1D_discretization.md), 
- [a 2-D resolution test for each **FD**-scheme using a gaussian temperature anomaly](./man/examples/Gaussian_Diffusion.md), and
- [a resolution test for a 2-D poisson problem](./man/examples/Poisson_ResTest.md). 

For more examples see the [example folder](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/examples/DiffusionEquation/). 

The [exercises](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/exercises/) include solving 
- the 1-D diffusion equation using the [forward](./man/exercises/02_1D_Heat_explicit.md) and [backward](.man/exercises/03_1D_Heat_implicit.md) Euler methods, 
- [a 2-D poisson problem](./man/exercises/04_2D_Diffusion_Stationary.md), and
- a time-dependent temperature distribution within the lithosphere assuming a [plume](./man/exercises/05_2D_Diffusion_TD_Plume.md) or [sill](.man/exercises/05_2D_Diffusion_TD_Sill.md).

### [Heat Advection Equation](./examples/AdvectionEquation/README.md)

To solve the *advective part* of the *temperature equation*, the ```GeoModBox.jl``` provides the following different methods: 
- an upwind scheme,
- the staggered -leaped frog scheme, 
- a semi-lagrangian advection, and
- passive tracers/markers. 

The solvers for a the tracer advection method are located in [src/Tracers](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/src/Tracers/), where the remaining advection routines are located in [src/AdvectionEquation](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/src/AdvectionEquation/). The routines are structured in such a way, that any property, as long as the property is defined on the *centroids* including *ghost nodes* on all boundaries, can be advected with the first **three** advection methods listed above. Using passive tracers, one can, so far, choose to either advect the temperature or phases. In case of advecting phases, one can define a certain rheology ($\eta$) or density ($\rho$) associated to each phase. The phase ID is used to interpolate the corresponding property from the tracers to the *centroids*. 

A key aspect for the advection equation is the conservation of the **amplitude** and the **shape** of an anomaly. Depending on the method, numerical diffusion or interpolation effects lead to strong deviations of the initial anomaly. For more details see [here](./man/AdvectMain.md). The ```GeoModBox.jl``` contains several [routines](https://github.com/LukasFuchs/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/src/InitialCondition/2Dini.jl) to setup a certain initial anomaly, either for properties defined on their correspondig grid (i.e., temperature, velocity, or phase) or for tracers advecting (so far) a certain temperature or phase. Within the examples and the exercise one can choose different initial temperature and velocity conditions.

The examples for a two dimensional advection problem include:
- [a 2-D advection, assuming a constant velocity field (e.g., a rigid body rotation)](./man/examples/2D_Advection.md), and
- [a resolution test of the same advection example](./examples/AdvectionEquation/2D_Advection_ResolutionTest.jl). 

&emsp; The exercises include a: 
- [1-D advection of a gaussian or block anomaly](./exercises/06_1D_Advection.ipynb), and
- [a 2-D advection coupled with the solution of the diffusion equation](./exercises/07_2D_Energy_Equation.ipynb).
