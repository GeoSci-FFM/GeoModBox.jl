# GeoModBox.jl

The **Geod**ynamic **Mod**elling Tool**Box** is a julia package mainly used for teaching purposes. The package provides different finite difference, staggered, discretization schemes to numerically solve the governing equations for a two-dimensional geodynamic problem. The governing equations are the conservation equations of 

1) [**energy**](./man/DiffMain.md), 
2) [**momentum**](./man/MomentumMain.md), 
3)  [**mass** and **compositon**](./man/AdvectMain.md). 

The ```GeoModBox.jl``` includes a series of [exercises](https://github.com/GeoSci-FFM/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/exercises/) and [examples](https://github.com/GeoSci-FFM/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/examples/) of different geodynamically well defined problems. The exercises are given as Jupyter notebooks for the students to complete. The theoretical background is mainly given here in the documentation.

## [Staggered Finite Difference](./man/GESolution.md)

To properly solve the governing equations, a staggered finite difference scheme is choosen for the *energy* and *momentum* equations. A staggered grid enables a correct, straight forward implementation of certain boundary conditions and enables the conservation of stress between the nodes in case of a variable viscosity. This also requires that certain parameters are defined on different grids. 

Here, the temperature, density, pressure are defined on the *centroids*, ... are defined on the *vertices*, the velocities are defined in between the *vertices*, and the viscosity is needed on both. 

For more details on how this is used in the ```GeoModBox.jl``` see [here](./man/GESolution.md).

## Energy Conservation Equation

In geodynamics, the energy is described by the temperature and needs to be conserved within a closed system. Here, we solve the *temperature conservation equation*, or *temperature equation*, using an *operator splitting* method, that is, we first solve the *advective* part of the *temperature equation*, followed by the *diffusive* part. 

### [Heat Diffusion Equation](./man/DiffMain.md)

The ```GeoModBox.jl``` provides different finite difference (**FD**) schemes to solve the *diffusive part* of the time-dependent or steady-state *temperature equation* including radioactive heating, in [1-D](./man/DiffOneD.md) and [2-D](./man/DiffTwoD.md). The solvers are located in [src/HeatEquation](https://github.com/GeoSci-FFM/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/src/HeatEquation/). So far, only *Dirichlet* and *Neumann* thermal boundary conditions are available. Most of the functions assume constant thermal parameters (except for the 1-D solvers and the 2-D defect correction solver). 

### [Heat Advection Equation](./man/AdvectMain.md)

The ```GeoModBox.jl``` provides different methods to advect certain properties within the model domain. The corresponding routines are structured in such a way, that any property can be advected with the described advection solvers, as long as the property is defined on the *centroids* including *ghost nodes* at all boundaries. Using passive tracers, one can, so far, choose to either advect the absolute temperature or the phase ID.

The tracers advect the phase ID, which is used to interpolate the density and viscosity on the centroids and vertices, respectively.
