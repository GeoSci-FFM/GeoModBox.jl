# [Falling Block Benchmar](https://github.com/GeoSci-FFM/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/examples/StokesEquation/2D/FallingBlockBenchmark.jl)

-> A sript, solving the falling block benchmark for a viscosity range from -6 to 6 order of magnitude. The script stores the [sinking velocity](../../assets/FallingBlock_SinkingVeloc_tracers.png) of the block at the initial configuration and the [final marker distribution](../../assets/FallingBlock_FinalStage_tracers.png) for models with a viscosity ration over and equal 0.
