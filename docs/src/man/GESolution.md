## Equation of State

In case of a thermal convection the density is considered to be temperature dependent. Thus, the buoyance term on the right-hand side of equation $(7)$ is temperature dependent (and pressure, but one can neglect this effect here so far) and can be approximated with the so-called *equation of state* for the density. Here, its is a linear approximation of the change of density due to temperature variations and can be defined as:

...*boussinesq equation* ... *scaling* ... *change of equations* ... *also valid for energy equation* ...

$\begin{equation}
\rho = \rho_0 (1-\alpha T),
\end{equation}$

where $œÅ_0$ is the reference density and $\alpha$ the thermal expansion coefficient [ $1/K$ ]. 

# Scaling
