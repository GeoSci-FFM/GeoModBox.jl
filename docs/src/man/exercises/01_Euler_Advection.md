# [01 - Euler Advection (1D)](https://github.com/GeoSci-FFM/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/exercises/01_1D_Euler_Advection_en.ipynb)

This exercise introduces programming with `Julia` and the numerical solution of a partial differential equation.  

The main objectives are to understand:

1. The discretization of the one-dimensional advection equation,  
2. The approximation of differential operators using finite differences, and  
3. The implementation and visualization of the solution in `Julia`.  

The equation is solved using the explicit Euler method, and the resulting particle advection is illustrated in Figure 1.
