# [07 - 2D Energy Equation](https://github.com/GeoSci-FFM/GeoModBox.jl/blob/main/exercises/07_2D_Energy_Equation_en.ipynb)

This exercise focuses on solving the two-dimensional energy conservation equation, which combines both **advection** and **diffusion** processes. The main objectives are:

1. Understand the combined transport of temperature by advection and diffusion,  
2. Learn to apply different numerical schemes for advection (upwind, semi-Lagrangian, tracers, etc.) and diffusion (explicit, implicit, Crankâ€“Nicolson, ADI, defect correction),  
3. Define different initial conditions for the temperature field (e.g., circular anomaly, Gaussian distribution, block anomaly, linear gradient),  
4. Explore prescribed velocity fields (rigid-body rotation, convection cell),  
5. Visualize and analyze the transient evolution of temperature fields and generate animations.

The example below shows the evolution of an initial linear temperature field in a constant shear cell velocity field (Figure 1).
